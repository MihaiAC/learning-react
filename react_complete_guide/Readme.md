Based on this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux), which covers React's key features and third-party libraries - Redux, React Router, TanStack Query, and Framer Motion, and a short Next.js tutorial.

Includes a mix of hands-on exercises and code-along examples, with some deeper dives into the docs where the course lacked detail.
