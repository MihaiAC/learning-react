# Sundaes-on-demand

An ice-cream flavoured app focused on learning to test with Vitest and getting some more React+TS and Tailwind practice. Had this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/) as a starting point.

## Changes from the course

- Switched from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- Replaced React Bootstrap components with custom-built ones.
- Styled the application using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Implemented routing with React Router and tested routes implicitly in the integration tests.
- Utilized Tanstack Query and Axios for data fetching (adjusted tests accordingly).
- Reduced reliance on hardcoded constants in both tests and code.

## How to Run

1. Download this folder.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.
3. Make sure the backend is running in the background. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://github.com/bonnie/udemy-TESTING-LIBRARY/tree/main/sundae-server).
4. Run `npm run dev`.
