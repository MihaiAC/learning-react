# Sundaes-on-demand

A project created to practice React, Typescript, and testing with Vitest.

## Changes from the Course Version

- Switched from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- Replaced React Bootstrap components with custom-built ones.
- Styled the application using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Implemented routing with React Router and tested routes implicitly in the integration tests.
- Utilized Tanstack Query and Axios for data fetching (adjusted tests accordingly).
- Reduced reliance on hardcoded constants in both tests and code.
