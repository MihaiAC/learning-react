React components
- contains all the necessary HTML, JS and potentially CSS;
- related code is stored together;
- different components have different responsibilities => separation of concerns;
Component:
- must be a JS function;
- its name must start with an uppercase character;
- returns "render-able" content - most cases JSX, but can also return number, string, boolean, null or an array of those;

Can use component like a normal HTML element.
Entry point: `ReactDOM.createRoot(entryPoint).render(<App />);`
Import an image with a relative path -> must do for deployment.

### Props ###
== passing data to components.
e.g: `function ComponentName(props)`, in HTML `<ComponentName arg1=val1 arg2=val2 etc.`

Different ways to pass props to components.
`Component({arg1, arg2=defaultVal})`
`Component({...obj})`
